# Defense Tower

Raid, raid, raid.
You love it and you hate it.
It brings new challenge to your game, but it brings pain to you.
Isn't it painful to see your settlers die to raiders?

Fear not, now you have the option to defend your base, **with tower**!

_Side notes: The tower is also a lighthouse_

## Multiplayer

  range.
