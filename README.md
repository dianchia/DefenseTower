# Defense Tower

Raid, raid, raid.
You love it and you hate it.
It brings new challenge to your game, but it brings pain to you.
Isn't it painful to see your settlers die to raiders?
Fear not, now you have the option to defend your base, **with tower**!


# Multiplayer
This mod is required on both server and client.

# Important Notes:
- The tower will attack the closest mob, even if it is behind a tree! So be sure to clear out all trees in tower's range.

# Development Notes:
- This mod is nowhere near finish. Please expect a lot of bug fix and feature change.
- Texture of the tower is not yet done and will be changed in the near future.
